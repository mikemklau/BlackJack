Welcome to MKL Casino!

Blackjack is simple; the player closest to 21 when they both stand is the winner!

BlackJack Basics:
All non picture cards are worth their face value
All picture cards are a 10
All Aces can be either an 11 or 1
If you go over 21 you will "bust" and this means you automatically lose
Blackjack is when you get an Ace and a picture card as your first 2 cards, you will win and extra 50% on top of your initial bet!
Push means draw
Dealer MUST hit if his hand totals to 17
Dealer MUST stand if his hand totals to 16

Basic Controls:
Please click on the betting chips to place your bets
Hit means you want another card
Stand means you want to stick with what you got

Advanced:
if both your cards are the same (e.g 7,7 or K,K etc.) this means a split is available meaning you can split the cards into 2 hands
split will show up clearly automatically if it is available

double means you can double your initial bet, this is only available when your first 2 cards add up to 10 or 11 (e.g 5,6 or 3,8 etc.)

FOR BEST EXPERIENCE PLEASE PLAY WITH SOUND ON! 
GOOD LUCK AT THE TABLES!
